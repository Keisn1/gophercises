- key-value store
- as many read-only-transactions as one would like at a time
- only one read-write-transaction at a time
- individual transactions are not thread-safe
  - use locking to ensure only one go routine accesses a transaction
- Creating transaction from the DB is thread-safe
- read-only and read-write-transactions should not be in the same goroutine
