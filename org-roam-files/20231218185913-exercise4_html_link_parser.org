- from golang.org
  - provided by the go team
  - not same garantuees as the standard library
  - more flexible
  - not possible to have them on the same release schedule as the stdlib
- don't do the Tockenizer stuff
  - do the parse thing
- can ignore nested links
- get something working before focusing on edge-cases
  - don't worry about having perfect code
- some examples are provided
  - fourth example shall help you with comments

* Hint: See [[https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/html#NodeType][Node Type]] constants and look for the types that you can ignore
